# Math preparation #

Start with watching awesome [MIT Linear Algebra course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) via [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) - first 10 or so lectures would be enough for some time. <br>
And only then start reading books, if you need more content - good summary of Linear Algebra from Deep Learning book [Chapter 2](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html)

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Neural Networks Demystified | [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) | :star::star::star::star: | Good intro to neural networks - heavy on math, uses Python code |
| Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition | [Official page](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) <br> [Github](https://cs231n.github.io/) <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC)  | :star::star::star::star::star: | Start Deep Learning education from this one - focused on image processing. Many lectures presented by Andrej Karpathy in 2016 videos |
| Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program | [Official page](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) | :star::star::star::star::star: | $400 for 6 months course - you would need to spend at least 10h a week to complete it. Knowledge of Python 3.x and Numpy would make your life much easier - Pandas would help too. |
| Udacity Intro to Machine Learning | [Official page](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120) | :star::star::star::star: | Basics of ML - top algorithms, process to work with data, etc. <br> All code done in Python and scikit-learn - majority of test tasks are simple and very similiar |
| Coursera Machine Learning by Andrew Ng | [Official page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) | :star::star::star::star::star: | This course is classics by now - Coursera started from it and its very good at explaining classical ML algorithms. <br> One minor annoynce - tasks are done in Octave, but you could do them in Python using unofficial [Github repo](https://github.com/mstampfer/Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python) |
| Stanford CS224n: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing | [Official page](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) | In Progress | Focus - NLP with Deep Learning. <br> Previously known as [CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) |
| Deep Learning 101 | [Official page](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/introduction-deep-learning/) | Skip it | Tries to do overview without providing details - more like DP for non-IT person |
| Deep Learning with TensorFlow | [Official page](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/deep-learning-tensorflow/) | Skip it | Very high level with not enough "meat" |
| Tensorflow and deep learning - without a PhD by Martin Görner | [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2nnJ4g6N0) | :star::star::star: | 2.5h video trying to cover everything in DL area from beginning - IMHO its too shallow |
| MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning | [Official page](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkuNyzb8LmxFutYuPA7B4oiMn6cjD6Rs) | - | Short intro course |
 | Oxford Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing 2017 by Phil Blunsom | [Official page](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2016-2017/dl/) <br> [Github](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/) <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL613dYIGMXoZBtZhbyiBqb0QtgK6oJbpm) | - | Main Oxford NLP course | 
 | UC Berkeley CS 294: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Fall 2017 | [Official page](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6_40KJIwTmSbCv9OVJB3YaO4sFwkX) | - | |
 | MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars | [Official page](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) <br> [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf) | - | |
